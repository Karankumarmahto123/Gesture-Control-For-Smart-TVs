# ‚úã Gesture Recognition for Smart TV Control

## üìå Problem Statement

In the era of smart electronics, enhancing user experience through intuitive human-computer interaction is a key goal. This project, initiated by a home electronics company specializing in smart televisions, aims to develop a gesture-based control system that enables users to operate their TVs **without a remote** ‚Äî using simple hand gestures captured by the built-in webcam.

## üéØ Objective

Build a robust deep learning model that can recognize **five distinct hand gestures** from short video clips (2‚Äì3 seconds, 30 frames each). Each gesture corresponds to a specific TV command:

| Gesture        | Command                 |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| üëç Thumbs Up   | Increase volume          |
| üëé Thumbs Down | Decrease volume          |
| üëà Left Swipe  | Rewind 10 seconds        |
| üëâ Right Swipe | Fast forward 10 seconds  |
| ‚úã Stop (Palm) | Pause playback           |

## üìÇ Dataset Structure

The dataset is provided as a `.zip` file containing two main folders:

- `train/`
- `val/`

Each folder contains:

- A set of subfolders with **30 image frames** per video.
- A corresponding `.csv` file with the following columns:
  - `folder_name`: Name of the subfolder containing the gesture frames.
  - `gesture_label`: The gesture as a text label (e.g., `ThumbsUp`, `Stop`).
  - `label`: A numeric class ID (ranging from 0 to 4).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Videos are recorded in two resolutions: **360√ó360** and **120√ó160**. Standardization of image size is required during preprocessing.
